# ChaosRPC

ChaosRPC is a simple tool for reproducing transient errors on RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

## Concepts

- **Call Site**: A specific location in the code where an RPC call is made. It is composed of the call stack (including function names and linenos) and the RPC method name.

## Features

- **gRPC Support**: Unary and streaming RPC calls are supported.
- **HTTP Support**: Coming soon.

## Examples

Please refer to the `examples` directory.

- **Toy**: A simple toy service to demonstrate ChaosRPC.
- **SeaweedFS Issues**: Reproduce transient errors on RPC related to some issues.
